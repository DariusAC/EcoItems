    <h4 class="subheader">We did not have time to prototype the second part (We litterally typed over two hundred lines of HTML so far for this), however this is description is put in it's stead.  The idea is that higher voted items would rise to the top of a list of eco friendly inventions/ideas, then people could crowd fund those ideas, and they would be funded and go on the site, probably with a special tag or descriptor saying that it was created on this site.  Also the water bottles are filler, and I apologize for the misaligned products, it pains me too, I didn't have time to fix it.</h4>
